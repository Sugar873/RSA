RSA or Rivest-Shamir-Adleman algorithm is an algorithm used for secure data transmission. It is a public-key encryption algorithm, which means that it uses two different keys, one for encryption and one for decryption. The encryption key is a public key, which can be shared with anyone, while the decryption key is a private key, which must be kept secret by the owner.

This is me trying to recreate the RSA algorithm using C#
